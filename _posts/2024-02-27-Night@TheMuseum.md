## What is Night At The Museum?
Night at the museum is an event held by Del Norte High School, where people from their artistic classes get to show off the work they have done for their art classes to everyone at the school and anyone visiting. 

## What Did You Do? How was it?
My class of 22 worked together to make a singular game based off the hit Nintendo Game Mario. We were all split into groups of 4 or 5 and worked together to design a singular aspect of the game.
